### GloBES - a global, long-term annual data cube on the extents 
<p align="justify">
This repository provides the code behind GlobES, the 1<sup>st</sup> global data cube on ecosystem types, depicting per-pixel areas at 1-km resolution and at a global scale. Our data cube covers 65 ecosystem types across the terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and oceanic domains which are in line with the habitat type definitions of the International Union of Conservation and Nature (IUCN), which is used for in the red list species assessments. The original list of ecosystems and their definitions <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/habitat-classification-scheme">can be found here</a>.

The code provided in this repository was designed to accompany the submission of a dedicated paper where we provide a detailed description of the underlying methods. Consequently, we prioritized readibility over scalability and does not support large scale applications such as GlobES. Moreover, we modified our original code, which was supported on our own data structure and computational assets. Here, we generalized our code, but do not provide the raw data which is available online, although not having undergone our pre-processing steps. Therefore, our code should be seen solely as a guideline to reproduce our work, and not as a direct path to GlobES.
