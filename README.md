# GloBES
Code used to classify the GlobES data cube, a global, long-term annual data cube on the extents of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and oceanic ecosystem types.

The current code was re-designed based on the original to accompany the submission of a deidcated paper that provides an extensive description of our methods. Here, we prioritized readibility over scalability, requiring adaptation from individuals interested in using this code for large scale applications.

We welcome users and experts to help us review and improve our classification rulesets.
