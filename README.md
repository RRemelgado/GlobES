### GloBES - a global, long-term annual data cube on the extents 
This page describes the code behind GlobES, the 1<sup>st</sup> global data cube on ecosystem types, depicting per-pixel areas at 1-km resolution and at a global scale. Our data cube covers 65 ecosystem types across the terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and oceanic domains which are in line with the habitat type definitions of the International Union of Conservation and Nature (IUCN), which is used for in the red list species assessments. The original list of ecosystems and their definitions <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/habitat-classification-scheme">can be found here</a>.




#### Found some issues? Please Let us know.
We welcome interested parties to help us review and improve our classification rulesets.

#### Disclaimer
The current code was re-designed based on the original to accompany the submission of a dedicated paper that provides an extensive description of our methods. Here, we prioritized readibility over scalability, requiring adaptation from individuals interested in using this code for large scale applications.
