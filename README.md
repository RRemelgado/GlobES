### GloBES - a Global, long-term annual data on the extents of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and oceanic ecosystem types at 1-km resolution
<p align="justify">
This repository provides the code behind GlobES, the 1<sup>st</sup> global data cube on ecosystem types, depicting per-pixel areas at 1-km resolution and at a global scale. Our data cube covers 71 ecosystem types across the terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and oceanic domains which are in line with the habitat type definitions of the International Union of Conservation and Nature (IUCN), which is used for in the red list species assessments. The original list of ecosystems and their definitions <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/habitat-classification-scheme">can be found here</a>.

The code provided in this repository was designed to accompany the submission of a dedicated paper where we describe the underlying methods in detail. Consequently, we prioritized readibility over scalability, meaning this code does not support the imediate replication of GlobES. Moreover, we modified our original code, which was built on our own data structure and computational assets. Here, we generalized our code, but do not provide the raw data, all of which is available online in its original form. In conclusion, our code should be seen solely as a guideline to reproduce our work, and not as a direct path to GlobES.
